Our First Article: The Start of Indextoz Interactive

Welcome to our first official article! We’re Andrew and Winston, two young creators behind Indextoz Interactive, a tiny corporation focused on making HTML demos and games. We’re passionate about delivering fun, ad-free content that’s accessible to everyone.

In this article, we share our journey from hobbyist developers to launching our own corporation. We aim to inspire and provide insights into coding and design along the way. If you enjoy our work and want to support us, donations are always welcome.

Thanks for joining us—we’re excited for what’s ahead!
